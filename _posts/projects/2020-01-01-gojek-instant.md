<p>Developed the Instant service for the Transport team. Instant is Gojek's alternative allocation flow where customers and drivers connect via an in-person queue system using an OTP code. I lead the development of features, engineering improvements, and scaling new locations with above 90% code coverage. We also leveraged Redis's geo functionality to automatically react with notifications when driver supply is low.</p>
